A small personal project to keep track of the latest releases (vinyl, movie...)  
This app was built during my spare time as a way to explore and pratice full-stack development, it has no pretensions and no commercial purpose.

## :star: Features

- **Fetcher**: Back-end service that scrapes data from various public APIs and temporarily stores it  
- **Fetcher Viewer**: Desktop application for real-time monitoring of the scrapping process  
- **Web API**: Exposes the most recently scraped releases  
- **Web Client**: Front-End application that consumes the API to display the latest releases to users
